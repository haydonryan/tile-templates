Saved from this api call.

## mysql-1.9.10-resources.json
This file was generated by finding the job names and building this from a call to:
```https://opsmgr.sandbox.com/api/v0/staged/products/p-mysql-bbba5a1aee4d09b9960c/jobs/```. And then iterate through each job for example: ```https://opsmgr.sandbox.com/api/v0/staged/products/p-mysql-bbba5a1aee4d09b9960c/jobs/mysql-15560a4aea39508c6dc6/resource_config```
It'd be great to have OM output this from an existing foundation.
